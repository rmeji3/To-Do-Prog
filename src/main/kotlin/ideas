FEATURES
------------
dynamic array(MutableList) of objects(tasks)

bool for complete/not complete

string for task

array/vector for each individual task so you can easily add/remove individual ones

dates? like due dates maybe



IMPLEMENTATION
---------------
infinite while loop(user enters "exit" to exit to break)

first we have to take in the users input for the task and store it in a string

then we take in the users date as a string and concat the month and day then we cast it to an int and sort it like that

sortedBy function to sort classes by due date, this will sort it using the int property of the class
